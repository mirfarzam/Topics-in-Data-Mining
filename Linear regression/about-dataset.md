# Linear Regression Project

for this project I used a video-game dataset which contains data of Sales in different regions.Also users and critics scores are added to this dataset.

from kaggle :
##Context
This data set contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies along with critic and user ratings. It is a combined web scrape from VGChartz and Metacritic along with manually entered year of release values for most games with a missing year of release. The original coding was created by Rush Kirubi and can be found here, but it limited the data to only include a subset of video game platforms. Not all of the listed video games have information on Metacritic, so there data set does have missing values.

###The fields include:

- Name - The game's name
- Platform - Platform of the games release
- Year_of_Release - Year of the game's release
- Genre - Genre of the game
- Publisher - Publisher of the game
- NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
- EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions)
- Critic_score - Aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff
- Critic_count - The number of critics used in coming up with the critic score
- User_score - Score by Metacritic's subscribers
- User_count - Number of users who gave the user score
- Rating - The ESRB ratings
